# Calculator TypeScript Console Application

This repository contains a small project developed during a fundamentals course on TypeScript. The project is a calculator implemented in TypeScript that operates via the console.

## Course Overview

The Fundamentals of TypeScript course provided a foundational understanding of the TypeScript programming language. As part of the course, a calculator project was developed to showcase basic programming concepts and techniques using TypeScript. The calculator operates within a console environment.

## Features

- **TypeScript Programming**: Learn fundamental concepts of the TypeScript programming language.
- **Console Application**: Develop a calculator that operates via the console.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- **Console Input/Output**: Utilize console input/output mechanisms to interact with the calculator.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Calculator TypeScript Console Application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org

## Getting Started
